# Everybody Codes Solutions (everybody-codes-solutions)

My solutions to Everybody Codes programming puzzles 
(<https://everybody.codes/>). 

## Prerequisites:

1. Python 3 (last tested with version 3.12.3)

## Getting Started:

```
git clone https://github.com/William-D-Jones/everybody-codes-solutions.git
```

## Usage:

Each Python program accepts a single command-line input, which is the name
of the file containing the day's input. For example, run 2024 day 1 part 1 with:

```
python3 2024/day1-1.py 2024/input-2024-1-1.txt
```

Most programs one line of output, which is the answer to that part.
